"""
Implement a class Address. An address has a house number, a street, an optional apartment number, a city, a state, and a postal code. 
Define the constructor such that an object can be created in one of two ways: with an apartment number or without. 
Supply a print method that prints the address with the street on one line and the city, state, and postal code on the next line. 
Supply a method def comesBefore(self, other) that tests whether this address comes before other when compared by postal code.
